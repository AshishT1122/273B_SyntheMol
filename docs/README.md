[real.md](real.md): Instructions for processing Enamine REAL building blocks, reactions, and molecules.

[antibiotics.md](antibiotics.md): Instructions for generating antibiotic candidates. Includes instructions for processing antibiotics data, training bioactivity prediction models, generating molecules with SyntheMol, and selecting candidates. These steps reproduce the results in our paper [TODO](TODO).

[simulation.md](simulation.md): Instructions for performing a simulation study of SyntheMol using a computational molecular property, cLogP (the computed octanol-water partition coefficient). These steps reproduce the results in our paper [TODO](TODO).
